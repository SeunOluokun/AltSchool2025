        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Oluwaseun Oluokun. Seun for short.</p>
        
        <p>I studied medical physiology at the University of Lagos College of Medicine.</p>
        <p>After graduating university in 2019 , I worked for a year as a medical cardiologist and worked hard... at trying not to hate the job so much.. </p>
        
        <p>Don't get me wrong , it was fun playing with medical devices and giving patients gist while perfoming their cardiology scans.. </p>
        
        <p>I however didn't like what i was doing day to day .. I also did not find that i had any time for myself as i worked Monday - Saturday.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started programming in 2021 after seeing a SheCodes course on YouTube. I was soon after learnt SQL and got a job as a Database Developer late 2022.</p>
        
        <p>It's been 2 years in this same role, and  I have grown tired, feeling stuck and itching for a change. I know I can't get this change without Upskilling formally.</p>
        
        <p>So here I am, Ready to Upskill and Welcome New Challenges!</p>
